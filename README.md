# pebblevs

is a single-player 2D shooter game, where you have to eliminate the red enemies. Your gun automatically shoots and reloads, meaning you only have move around the map and aim!



Killing them will give you coins that you can use to upgrade
your own abilities or the enemies themselves. Each kill rewards you with 2 coins which you can spend on buffs:

- Bullet damage (10 coins)
- Reload speed (10 coins)
- Movement speed (20 coins)
- Stronger enemies (5 coins)



You only have **20 health points**, so spend your coins wisely! The objective is to eliminate *300 red enemies* in
the fastest time possible :) Have fun!
